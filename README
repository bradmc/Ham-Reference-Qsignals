VERSION
    Version 0.01

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SYNOPSIS
     my $q = new Ham::Reference::Qsignals;

     # use the get() function to get a single meaning for a particular Q signal

     print $q->get('qrp');
     print "\n";

     # use a hash reference to get all Q signals at once
     # the following will display all signals and meanings

     my $hashref = $q->get_hashref();
     foreach (sort keys %$hashref)
     {
            print "$_ = $hashref->{$_}\n";
     }

DESCRIPTION
    The "Ham::Reference::Qsignals" module is a quick reference to the ARRL
    suggested Q signal set. Other Q signal sets may be added in the future,
    but the primary mission of this module is for Amateur Radio
    applications.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new()
     Usage    : my $q = Ham::Reference::Qsignals->new();
     Function : creates a new Ham::Reference::Qsignals object
     Returns  : A Ham::Reference::Qsignals object
     Args     : an anonymous hash:
                key         required?   value
                -------     ---------   -----
                signal_set  no          select the set of Q signals
                                        the only set for now, and the default set
                                        is arrl

METHODS
  get()
     Usage    : my $description = $q->get( 'qrp' );
     Function : gets a single meaning for a given Q signal
     Returns  : a string
     Args     : you can get a full list of Q signals by accessing the keys of
                of the hashref returned by get_hashref() function
                (see the synopsis for example)

  get_hashref()
     Usage    : my $hashref = $q->get_hashref();
     Function : get all q signals
     Returns  : a hash reference
     Args     : n/a
